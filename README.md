## Development

### Local Testing

1. Make code changes
2. Reload extension at `chrome://extensions/`
3. Test on x.com or twitter.com

### Testing & Quality

```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run test:install     # Install Playwright browsers (first time only)

# Run tests
npm test                 # Unit tests only (fast)
npm run test:e2e         # Full E2E tests with X.com integration
npm run test:e2e:headed  # E2E tests with browser UI visible

# Code quality
npm run lint             # ESLint
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript validation
```

**Test Requirements:**
- Node.js 18+
- Create `.env` file with X.com test credentials (see `tests/README.md`)
- E2E tests require Chrome/Chromium and internet connection

For detailed testing documentation, see [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md).

### Pre-Push Hook

This project uses **Husky** to enforce code quality before pushing to remote:

**What runs automatically on `git push`:**
1. üîç **ESLint** - Code linting
2. üìù **TypeScript** - Type checking
3. üß™ **Unit Tests** - 97 unit tests
4. üé≠ **E2E Tests** - Full workflow tests on real X.com

**Total time:** ~2-3 minutes

**To bypass** (emergency only): `git push --no-verify`

The hook ensures all code pushed to remote is tested and working. Configure your test credentials in `.env` before your first push.

### Debugging

- **Popup**: Right-click extension icon ‚Üí Inspect popup
- **Content Script**: Open DevTools on x.com (F12) ‚Üí Check console
- **Service Worker**: `chrome://extensions/` ‚Üí Click "service worker" link
- **Tests**: `npm run test:e2e:debug` for Playwright inspector
