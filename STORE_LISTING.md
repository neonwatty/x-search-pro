## Single Purpose Statement

X Search Pro is a productivity tool that simplifies the creation and management of X/Twitter advanced search queries. Its single purpose is to provide an intuitive interface for building, saving, and applying complex X/Twitter searches without requiring users to learn or memorize advanced search syntax.

## Permission Justifications

### storage
Required to save user-created search queries, categories, and preferences locally in the browser. This enables users to build a library of reusable searches that persist across browser sessions and sync across their Chrome browsers.

### activeTab
Required to apply search queries to the active X/Twitter tab. When users click "Apply Search," the extension needs to access the current tab to navigate to X/Twitter with the generated search query, or to insert the query into X/Twitter's search box.

### Host Permissions (x.com/*, twitter.com/*)
Required to inject the sidebar interface on X.com and Twitter.com pages. This allows users to access their saved searches directly while browsing X/Twitter through a toggleable sidebar, providing quick one-click access to apply any saved search without opening the extension popup.
