**Build Your Personal X/Twitter Search Library**

X.com has advanced search (`x.com/search-advanced`), but it has no memory. Every time you need to monitor brand mentions, track competitors, or find viral content, you rebuild the same complex query from scratch.

X Search Pro solves this by letting you **save your searches** and build a personal library you can organize with categories, colors, and quick filters.

**üéØ What X.com's Advanced Search Can't Do**

| Feature | X.com Advanced Search | X Search Pro |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| Build complex queries | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Save searches** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Unlimited |
| **Categorize** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Custom categories |
| **Color coding** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Visual organization |
| **Quick access** | ‚ùå Navigate to `/search-advanced` | ‚úÖ Sidebar + popup |
| **Templates** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ 10 pre-loaded |
| **Filter your library** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Instant search |
| **Search counts** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Per category |

**Bottom line:** X.com's advanced search is a tool you use once. X Search Pro is a library you build over time.

X Search Pro gives X.com's advanced search what it's been missing: **memory**. Build your search library once, organize it with categories and colors, and access it with one click.

Stop rebuilding. Start organizing.

## Single Purpose Description

**Single Purpose**: Enhance X/Twitter's search functionality with an intuitive interface

X Search Pro serves a single, well-defined purpose: to simplify and enhance the search experience on X/Twitter. The extension provides a user-friendly interface for creating, saving, and managing complex search queries that would otherwise require memorizing and manually typing cryptic search operators.

All features directly support this single purpose:
- The search builder helps users create queries without knowing syntax
- Saved searches eliminate repetitive query creation
- Templates provide starting points for common search patterns
- The sidebar provides quick access to searches while browsing X/Twitter

This focused approach ensures users know exactly what the extension does and maintains a consistent, predictable experience aligned with Chrome Web Store policies.

## Why These Permissions?

**storage** - Required to save your custom searches and preferences locally, enabling the core functionality of the extension.

**activeTab** - Needed to inject search queries into X/Twitter's search box when you click on a saved search.

**Host permissions (x.com, twitter.com)** - Essential for displaying the sidebar interface and applying searches directly on X/Twitter pages.
