## Single Purpose Description

**Single Purpose**: Enhance X/Twitter's search functionality with an intuitive interface

X Search Pro serves a single, well-defined purpose: to simplify and enhance the search experience on X/Twitter. The extension provides a user-friendly interface for creating, saving, and managing complex search queries that would otherwise require memorizing and manually typing cryptic search operators.

All features directly support this single purpose:
- The search builder helps users create queries without knowing syntax
- Saved searches eliminate repetitive query creation
- Templates provide starting points for common search patterns
- The sidebar provides quick access to searches while browsing X/Twitter

This focused approach ensures users know exactly what the extension does and maintains a consistent, predictable experience aligned with Chrome Web Store policies.

## Why These Permissions?

**storage** - Required to save your custom searches and preferences locally, enabling the core functionality of the extension.

**activeTab** - Needed to inject search queries into X/Twitter's search box when you click on a saved search.

**Host permissions (x.com, twitter.com)** - Essential for displaying the sidebar interface and applying searches directly on X/Twitter pages.
